# TrafficTimeWaste
This is a preparation project for the "Maturaarbeit"

In our team: Simon Baumgartner, Albin Bommer, Marc Himmelberger

We are creating / have created an app for Android, that can give travellers tips to entertain themselves
while they're in a traffic jam - at least that's the intended use case, but we're sure it can be applied more generally.

We're using Android Studio and distributing only through this repository - not on Google Play.
